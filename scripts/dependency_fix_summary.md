# Dependency Compatibility Fix Summary

## Issue
- **Problem**: `sentence-transformers==2.2.2` was incompatible with newer `huggingface-hub` versions
- **Error**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'cached_download' from 'huggingface_hub'`
- **Impact**: Visual boundary detection couldn't load, preventing the use of CLIP-based document boundary detection

## Solution
1. **Updated sentence-transformers** from `2.2.2` to `3.0.1` in `backend/requirements.txt`
2. **Ran upgrade command**: `pip install --upgrade sentence-transformers==3.0.1`

## Verification
- ✅ Visual boundary detector now imports successfully
- ✅ CLIP model (clip-ViT-B-32) loads correctly
- ✅ All boundary detection tests pass (4/4)
- ✅ Visual detection produces same results as pattern detection on test PDF

## Test Results
```
Visual detection found: 2 documents
- Document 1: CONTRACT (2 pages)
- Document 2: CONTRACT (1 page)

Pattern detection found: 2 documents (same result)
```

## Files Changed
- `backend/requirements.txt`: Updated sentence-transformers version

## Next Steps
The visual boundary detection feature is now fully functional and can be used for:
- Better handling of scanned documents
- Visual similarity-based boundary detection
- Future integration with LayoutLM for advanced detection
